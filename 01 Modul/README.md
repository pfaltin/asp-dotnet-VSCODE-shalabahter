## Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values.
Every variable has a type that determines what values can be stored in the variable.
C# is a type-safe language and the C# compiler guarantees that values stored in variables are always of the appropriate type. 

#### Exercises:

1. 001_exercise
	- With the help of basic variables and the Console.ReadLine() command save two values, then assign variable "a" the entered value of variable "b" and assign variable "b" the entered value of variable "a"

2. 002_exercise
	- Using basic variables and arithmetic operators write a simple program that takes distance and time as input and displays speed km/h and mph.


## Conditional statements

C# conditional statements are used when we want to execute a certain action depending upon an available condition.
C# conditional statements can be divided on `if-else` and `switch-case`.

#### Exercises:

1. 001_exercise
	- Using If statement write a simple program to find eligibility for admission to professional studies

2. 002_exercise
	- Using Switch statement write a simple menu-driven program to perform a calculation of two numbers

3. 003_exercise
